# Modern minimalistic TypeScript, Node.js, Express template

This is a template for starting back-end projects with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Jest.

## What this template includes 

This template includes a basic setup for a Node.js application using modern TypeScript. Here's what's inside:

- **Node.js**: As our runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: As our main programming language, providing static types.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity for testing our application.

This setup also includes a pre-configured linter (ESLint)

The project structure is organized by feature, which makes it easier to navigate through the codebase.
